summary: A simple rhythm I use with new engineering managers joining my organisation.

Week one with a new manager is about psychological safety. I ask them to shadow decision forums and write down every unanswered question.

Week two we co-design a growth plan for their team that balances customer bets with platform health.

By week four they own a ritual—usually either incident review or roadmap refresh. Giving clear ownership early builds confidence and makes support requests concrete.
