Building large marketplace features means a lot of telemetry, but not every graph deserves a meeting. I lean on three signals:

1. Deployment frequency feels healthy when teams can release daily without ceremony.
2. Flow efficiency tells us if we are investing in discovery or waiting on decisions.
3. Customer-impact incidents remind us that resilience beats raw velocity.

When these drift, we run a blameless retro that asks one question: *what friction should leadership remove next?* The answers drive the coaching backlog for the next sprint.
